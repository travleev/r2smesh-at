``fine_mesh_content``
###################

The ``fine_mesh_content`` file is a concatenate (e.g. by
``scripts/combine.sh``) of ``outcellsN`` files generated by ``MCNP-md``. Each line of the file has
the following format::

    i  j  k     Xmid   Ymid   Zmid    N   H    n1 h1 m1   n2 h2 m2 ... nN hN mN

where  ``i``, ``j`` and ``k``  are indices of the mesh element along x, y and z
axes, respectively, ``Xmid``, ``Ymid`` and ``Zmid`` are coordinates of the
element's center, ``N`` is the number of cells detected within the mesh element
and ``H`` is the number of points sampled within the mesh element. 

The rest of the line contains ``N`` triples, specifying the cell index ``n``,
number of hits in this cell ``h`` and the cell material index ``m`` for all
cells detected in the mesh element. Note that ``n`` and ``m`` are cell and
material indices, not names as used in the MCNP input file. Correspondence
between indices and names is printed by ``MCNP-md`` in "print table CMI", see ``cmi_table``

It holds: ``H = sum(h_i), i = 1 .. N``.

Only mesh elements with materials (i.e. there is at least one non-void cell in
the mesh element) are listed in the file.

This is the print table generated by ``MCNP-md`` and extracted from output by
``scripts/extract_tables.sh`` script. The table content is clear from its heading::

``N`` -- number of material compositions, ``I`` is the material index, ``M`` is
the material name and ``K`` is the number of nuclides in material composition.
Nuclide names are given in both formats, as used in MCNP, for example ``1001``
and as used in Fispact, for example ``H001`` or ``Fe054``. The nuclide name is
followed by its atom fraction.
