# R2Smesh
This is an implementation of the rigorous 2-step (R2S) method to calculate
shutdown dose rates (SDDR) due to neutron irradiation of materials. The method
comprises the following steps: (1) Simulation of neutron transport to obtain
neutron flux spatial and energy distribution; (2) inventory calculations and
activation analysis to obtain decay gamma source intensity and spactra as
spatial distribution; (3) simulation of the decay gamma transport. The R2Smesh
system presented in this repo organizes dataflow between the steps. 

There are several stand-alone codes to simulate neutron and gamma transport and
to perform inventory calculations. This system uses MCNP5 for neutron and gamma
transport and FISPACT-II for inventory calculations. 

The implementation in this repo is written from scratch, but in some aspects mimics the
R2Smesh developed in KIT/INR in 2005 (?) -- 2014.

A short recipe how to start calculations can be found in the
[recipe](doc/recipe.rst) and [deploy](/deploy.rst).



# Note for collaborators
Current github policy allows only two types of access rights for private
repositories, owned by a user account: (1) the owner and (2) the collaborator.
Both have rights to write directly to the repository. 

Instead of directly introducing changes to this repository, the proposed way
for collaborators is to fork this repository, make chages to the forked repo
and make pull requests from the forked repo to this one. In this way only
accepted pull requests (i.e. reviewed code changes) will appear here.

Contact the owner (currently <anton.travleev@gmail.com>) for any questions.
